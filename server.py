''' If phase is 'over' or 'freezetime', most likely any comments relate to the PREVIOUS round.
But the round number starts from zero, so in human terms, it's actually necessary to *add* one
to the round number whenever the phase is 'live'.

TODO: Notetaker.
* Make use of ~/shed/notes.py
* Triggered within the CS:GO ecosystem, a way to take notes on the current round.
  - See above re round numbers
  - If warmup, report round zero
  - If spectating, say who's being spec'd, just in case
    - Test this - can we get the name of the person or just the id? Can we look up the
      id and get a name? (I think it's a Steam ID.) Can we at least get the observer_slot?
* It's not possible while playing to get the current round timers, I believe. It IS,
  however, possible to notice the round number change (and freeze time end), and record
  the time. For the purposes of note-taking, a few seconds here or there doesn't matter.
* After notes have been taken, the text form should be shown in some visible way. This
  is probably best just done by writing to a file, and then tailing that file - would
  play nicely with CroppedTerm for the stream.

Would be REALLY cool if it could also record any typed text for those few seconds. During
freeze time, I would have to be aware of hitting G but most other keys would be safe.

Voice trigger???? "Bacon!"

Now all I need to do is run this:
$ ~/shed/notes.py `curl http://localhost:27013/status`
